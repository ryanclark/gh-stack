## Creating Stacked PRs

### What is a Stacked PR? How is it different from a regular PR?

A Stacked PR is a pull request that is part of an ordered chain of PRs, where each PR targets the branch of the PR below it instead of targeting `main` directly. Each PR in the stack represents one focused layer of a larger change. Individually, each PR is still a regular pull request — it just has a different base branch, and GitHub understands the relationship between the PRs in the stack.

### How do I create a Stacked PR?

You can create a stack using the `gh stack` CLI:

```sh
gh stack init auth-layer
# ... make commits on the first branch ...
gh stack add api-routes
# ... make commits ...
gh stack add request-validation
# ... make commits ...
gh stack submit
```

You can also create stacks entirely from the GitHub UI — create the first PR normally, then when creating subsequent PRs, select the option to add them to a stack. See [Creating a Stack from the UI](/gh-stack/guides/ui/#creating-a-stack-from-the-ui) for a walkthrough.

### How do I add PRs to my stack?

Use `gh stack add <branch-name>` to add a new branch on top of the current stack. When you run `gh stack submit`, a PR is created for each branch, and they are linked together as a Stack on GitHub.

You can also add PRs to an existing stack from the GitHub UI. See [Adding to an Existing Stack](/gh-stack/guides/ui/#adding-to-an-existing-stack) for details.

### How can I modify my stack?

Reordering or inserting branches into the middle of a stack is not currently supported. To restructure a stack, use `gh stack unstack` to tear it down and then re-create it with `gh stack init --adopt`:

```sh
# 1. Remove the stack
gh stack unstack

# 2. Make structural changes (reorder, rename, delete branches)
git branch -m old-name new-name

# 3. Re-create the stack with the new structure
gh stack init --adopt branch-2 branch-1 branch-3
```

### How do I delete my stack?

**From the CLI** — Run `gh stack unstack` (or `gh stack delete`) to delete the stack on GitHub and remove local tracking. Use `--local` to only remove local tracking.

**From the UI** — You can unstack PRs from the GitHub UI — see [Unstacking](/gh-stack/guides/ui/#unstacking) for a walkthrough. This dissolves the association between PRs, turning them back into standard independent PRs.

### Can stacks be created across forks?

No, Stacked PRs currently require all branches to be in the same repository. Cross-fork stacks are not supported.

## Checks, Rules & Requirements

### How are branch protection rules evaluated for Stacked PRs?

Every PR in a stack is treated as if it is targeting the **base of the stack** (typically `main`), regardless of which branch it directly targets. This means:

- **Required reviews** are evaluated as if the PR is targeting the stack base.
- **Required status checks** are evaluated as if the PR is targeting the stack base.
- **CODEOWNERS** are evaluated from the stack base — changes in `CODEOWNERS` on a PR at the bottom of the stack will not affect PRs above it in the stack.
- **Code scanning workflows** are evaluated as if the PR is targeting the stack base.

### How do GitHub Actions work with Stacked PRs?

GitHub Actions workflows trigger as if each PR in the stack is targeting the base of the stack (e.g., `main`). If you have a workflow configured to run on `pull_request` events targeting `main`, it will run for **every PR in the stack** — not just the bottom one.

### Do all previous PRs need to be passing checks before I can merge?

Yes. In order to merge a PR in the stack, **all PRs below it** must also have passing checks and meet all merge requirements. For example, in a stack of `main <- PR1 <- PR2 <- PR3`, if you want to merge PR #3, both PR #1 and PR #2 must have passing checks, required reviews, and satisfy all branch protection rules.

### Is a linear history required?

Yes. There must be a **fully linear history** between each of the branches in the stack. This is a strict requirement for merging.

If the stack is not linear (e.g., after changes were pushed to a lower branch), you can fix it in two ways:

- **From the CLI** — Run `gh stack rebase` to perform a cascading rebase locally and then push with `gh stack push`.
- **From the UI** — Click the **Rebase Stack** button in the merge box to trigger a cascading rebase across all branches in the stack.

## Merging Stacked PRs

### What conditions need to be met for a Stacked PR to be mergeable?

Every PR in a stack must meet the same merge requirements as a PR targeting the stack base (e.g., `main`): required reviews, passing CI checks, CODEOWNER approvals, and a linear history. All PRs below it must also meet these requirements. See the [Checks, Rules & Requirements](#checks-rules--requirements) section above for details.

### How does merging a stack of PRs differ from merging a regular PR?

Stacks must be merged **from the bottom up**. When you merge a PR, all non-merged PRs below it in the stack are also merged. After a PR is merged, the remaining stack is automatically rebased so the next PR targets `main` directly.

### What happens when you merge a PR in the middle of the stack?

You cannot merge a PR in the middle of the stack before the PRs below it are merged. PRs must be merged in order from the bottom up.

### How does squash merge work?

Squash merges are fully supported. Each PR in the stack produces one clean, squashed commit when merged. The rebase engine automatically detects squash-merged PRs and replays commits from the remaining branches onto the squashed result.

### How does merge commit work?

When you merge a stack using the merge commit strategy, it creates **one merge commit for the entire group** of PRs being merged. The full commit history of each PR is preserved within the merge commit.

### How does rebase merge work?

With rebase merge, all of the commits from each PR in the stack are replayed onto the base branch one at a time, creating a linear history without merge commits.

### Do all PRs get merged at once or one at a time?

PRs in a stack are merged sequentially, from the bottom up. When you initiate a merge, the bottom PR is merged first, and then the next PR above it, and so on. 

Commits are not all landed in a single atomic operation — each PR is merged individually in sequence.

### Can I merge only part of a stack? What happens to the remaining unmerged PRs?

Yes, partial stack merges are supported. After the merge, the lowest unmerged PR is updated to explicitly target the stack base (e.g., `main`). A cascading rebase is also automatically run to rebase the remaining unmerged branches.

### What happens if you close a PR in the middle of the stack?

Closing a PR in the middle of the stack will block all PRs above it from being mergeable. The stack relationship is preserved, so if you want to open a different PR or modify the stack, you will need to unstack and then re-create the stack.

### What happens when there is an error merging a PR in the middle of a stack?

If a merge fails (e.g., due to a failing check or merge conflict), the operation stops and no subsequent PRs are merged. You'll need to resolve the issue before continuing.

### Do Stacked PRs support merge queue?

Yes, Stacked PRs fully support merging via merge queue. When you merge a stack through the merge queue:

- **All PRs in the stack are added to the queue** in the correct order, ensuring a linear sequence.
- **If a PR is removed or ejected from the merge queue**, all PRs above it in the stack are also ejected and removed from the queue.
- **Stacks can be split across merge groups** in the merge queue — not all PRs in the stack need to be in the same merge group.

## Local Development

### Do you have a CLI to help manage stacks?

Yes! The `gh stack` CLI extension handles creating stacks, adding branches, rebasing, pushing, navigating, and syncing. Install it with:

```sh
gh extension install github/gh-stack
```

See the [CLI Reference](/gh-stack/reference/cli/) for the full command documentation.

### Do I need to use the GitHub CLI?

No. Stacked PRs are built on standard git branches and regular pull requests. You can create and manage them manually with `git` and the GitHub UI. The CLI just makes the workflow much simpler — especially for rebasing, pushing, and creating PRs with the correct base branches.

### Will this work with a different tool for stacking?

Yes, you can continue to use your tool of choice (e.g., jj, Sapling, ghstack, git-town, etc.) to manage stacks locally and push up your branches to GitHub.

Stacked PRs on GitHub are based on the standard pull request model — any tool that creates PRs with the correct base branches can work with them. The `gh stack` CLI is purpose-built for the GitHub experience, but other tools that manage branch chains should be compatible.

You can also use the GitHub CLI in conjunction with other tools to open your PRs as a stack:

```bash
# Create a stack of branches locally using jj
jj new main -m "first change"
jj bookmark create change1 --revision @
# ...

jj new -m "second change"
jj bookmark create change2 --revision @
# ...

jj new -m "third change"
jj bookmark create change3 --revision @
# ...

# Use gh stack to submit a stack of PRs
gh stack init --adopt change1 change2 change3
gh stack submit
```
